# Resolved Issues Documentation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Runtime Errors in Browser**
   - **Issue**: The project was experiencing runtime errors in the browser.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created separate pages for About, Projects, and Contact sections to improve code organization and reduce complexity.
     - Updated the email API route to use HTML strings instead of JSX, which is more compatible with newer versions of Next.js.
     - Created a .env.local file with the required environment variables for the email functionality.

2. **Navigation Structure**
   - **Issue**: All sections were on a single page with hash links.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created separate pages for each major section (About, Projects, Contact).
     - Updated the navigation links to point to these new pages.
     - Added navigation buttons on the home page to guide users to the different sections.

3. **Email Functionality**
   - **Issue**: The email API route was using JSX directly, which can cause issues with newer versions of Next.js.
   - **Solution**: 
     - Updated the email API route to use HTML strings instead of JSX.
     - Added proper environment variables in .env.local for the email service.

## Changes Made

3. **Fixed Email Functionality**
   - Updated `src/app/api/send/route.js` to use HTML strings instead of JSX

## Testing Results

All functionality has been tested and is working correctly:

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Variables**: Before deploying to production, make sure to set up the actual Resend API key and email address in the .env.local file.
2. **Image Alt Text**: There are some warnings about missing alt text for images that should be addressed for better accessibility.
3. **Tailwind CSS Warnings**: There are some warnings about renamed color names in Tailwind CSS that could be updated in the configuration.

## Additional Changes

1. **Certificate Viewing Functionality**
   - **Issue**: The Cisco Networking Academy certificate was not clickable to view in a maximized view, unlike the other certificates.
   - **Solution**: Added the cursor-pointer class and onClick handler to the Cisco Networking Academy certificate image to make it clickable and display in a modal when clicked.

2. **Profile Photo Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: The user requested to have their photo displayed in the About page left corner with a round frame.
   - **Solution**:
     - Modified the image in the AboutSection component to have a rounded frame with a purple border and a pulsing blue border effect for better visual appeal
     - Updated the component to use the existing hero-image.jpeg file from the project
     - Created documentation in profile-image-instructions.md about the profile image
     - Set the image size to 200x200 pixels
     - Adjusted the positioning to place the image below the LOGO and to the left
     - Changed the image style from circular to square as per user's request
